configurations:
6 (groups) x 6 (scouts) x 3 (time) x 2 (landmarks) x 10 (enemies) x 2

groups = 6
s = 1, 3, 15, 16, 25, 100 ====> 6
turns - not enoughish, just enough, too much ===> 3
landmarks - sparse, dense ====> 2
enemies - random (w 10%, 1%), diagonal, clustering ===> 6 + 4 = 10
boards - 11 (with s = 1,3,15) , 20 (with s = 1,3,15), 100 (s = 3, 16, 25, 100)
